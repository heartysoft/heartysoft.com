<p>Got this email today:</p>
<p><em>"Congratulations! We are pleased to present you with the 2011 Microsoft&reg; MVP Award! This award is given to exceptional technical community leaders who actively share their high quality, real world expertise with others. We appreciate your outstanding contributions in ASP.NET/IIS technical communities during the past year."</em></p>
<p>That's three on the trot and it feels great to have done it before the 25 year milestone :)</p>
<p>And so begins another year of contributing to the community. I have to thank Abhishek (my former MVP lead), Claire (my current lead), Microsoft and anybody in the community who helped, or was helped by, me. Right...back to business.&nbsp;</p>
