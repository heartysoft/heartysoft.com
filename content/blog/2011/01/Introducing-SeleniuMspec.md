<p>Happy new year to you all. And to celebrate, I’ve just published my first codeplex project. SeleniuMspec is a template that you can use to generate MSpec BDD tests from Selenium IDE. I’ve been using both Selenium and MSpec for a while now and thought this might save a few seconds when writing some integration tests.</p>  <p>I’d welcome any ideas / help on improving it.
