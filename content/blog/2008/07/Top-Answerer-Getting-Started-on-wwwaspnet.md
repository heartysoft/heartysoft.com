<p>Just made the top answerer for the Getting Started section on the <a href="http://www.asp.net/">www.asp.net</a> forums :)</p>

<p>I overtook the awesome vinz. Of course, he's likely to bounce back tomorrow; and of course, he leads a lot of the boards I visit - the guy has endless time (and knowledge)&nbsp;:D</p>
<p>I joined the forums way back in January 2007. I was more of a consumer back then. Since May, I've been actively trying to help others on the forums. I've learned a lot helping others, and it's jolly good fun (and practice). I'll likely make Star (7500+ points) in a few days, and I fully intend to continue.</p>
<p>See you guys there :D</p>
