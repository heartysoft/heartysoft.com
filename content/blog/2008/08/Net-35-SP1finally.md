<p>Fate has a weird sense of humour. I held out from installing .net 3.5 sp1 all through the CTPs, then beta 1 and beta 2. This is also the first time I restrained myself from installing new stuff (coz simply put, having to uninstall a bunch of betas and patches and what not was getting to me). Well, I couldn't hold out any longer. I downloaded the entire thing. My internet is pretty crap, so I had to download the packages individually, then run a command line switch to download the final files. After that, was a quite long install. It failed. I removed silverlight tools. Tried again. Worked perfectly. I played around for a few hours. Made a few apps. Liked the new stuff quite a bit. And then, at 4 am, I went to bed.</p>
<p>I wake up, and what do I see? Damn you Microsoft...you just released the final .net 3.5 sp1 bits while I was asleep. Couldn't you have done it ONE day earlier or a month later? It HAD to be today, right? Why God, WHY?!?!?!</p>
<p>Ah well...guess I'll be downloading it all over again. And I gues I can forgive MS as the sp1 is actually available as an ISO. That is SO much more convenient to me. Thanks guys.</p>
