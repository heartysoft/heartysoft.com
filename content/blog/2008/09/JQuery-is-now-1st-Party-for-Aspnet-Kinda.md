<p>Wow...AMAZING&hellip;Hurray&hellip;I mean, like, WOW man&hellip;</p>
<p>In a very welcome turn of events, JQuery is now &ldquo;officially&rdquo; going to be part of Asp.net development. MS will provide support, annotated VS versions that&rsquo;ll give us intellisense, provide us with demonstrations and tutorials on how jquery can work with features like the AJAX Control Toolkit, Asp.Net AJAX, client side templates &ndash; and all the time without modifying, forking or otherwise changing jquery. This is surprising, and in a very pleasant way.</p>
<p>When I looked at the <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/bleroy/archive/2008/07/02/asp-net-ajax-roadmap-published.aspx">Asp.net AJAX Roadmap</a> a while back, I thought that a lot of it was what jquery does (css selectors, anyone?). I actually liked the idea as I use JQuery a lot, and it appeared a lot of the neat features were headed our way. I was grateful cause I do believe community interest in jquery is what put those features in the roadmap. I thought that was the best we could expect&hellip;and I thought the only &ldquo;better&rdquo; move would be for MS to buy jquery.</p>
<p>Well, MS seems to have done even better with this move. Instead of killing it off, they&rsquo;ve joined it and are going to make it an even better experience using jquery alongside asp.net. This works so well for the &ldquo;Dark Empire&rdquo; persona of MS and integrates so nicely into the ecosystem. Well done, bravo, outstanding&hellip;can&rsquo;t say it enough time really.</p>
<p>Scott Hanselman has put up a <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/jQuerytoshipwithASPNETMVCandVisualStudio.aspx">tutorial</a> already on how this&rsquo;ll work with Astoria (ok&hellip;ADO.Net data services, but Astoria is such a cool name!) and client templates. I&rsquo;ve been using asp.net AJAX and jquery together for some time now. And I can say it works exactly like I expected it to work. No need to re-learn MS-specific jquery, no hassle &ndash; it just works.</p>
<p>And lastly, MS will provide bug reports, patches, tests etc. to the jquery project and &ldquo;<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/09/28/jquery-and-microsoft.aspx">These will all go through the standard jQuery patch review process.</a>&rdquo;</p>

<li>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t beat &lsquo;em&hellip;buy &lsquo;em&rdquo;.</li>
<li>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t beat &lsquo;em&hellip;join &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t beat &lsquo;em&hellip;support &lsquo;em and make &lsquo;em even better for your own benefit.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I never imagined option 3 was even possible for MS. All I can say is I&rsquo;m jumping for joy!!</p>
