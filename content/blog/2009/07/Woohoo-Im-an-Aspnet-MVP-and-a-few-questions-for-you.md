<p>I was announced asp.net MVP today. It&rsquo;s great to receive the award as a recognition of my activities at the asp.net forums. I hope I can continue to help people out there and that this site will grow in the process. It&rsquo;s my first time receiving the award and hopefully it won&rsquo;t be the last. In an attempt to hold on to it(!), I&rsquo;ll ask you guys&hellip;what should I write about? What aspects of asp.net do you want me to cover? I&rsquo;ll be posting some video tutorials soon. What topics do you want me to go through? Lemme know and I just might listen ;).</p>
