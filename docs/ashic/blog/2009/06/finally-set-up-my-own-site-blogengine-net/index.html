            <p><p>I&rsquo;ve been looking to set up my own site for quite some time now. The things I had in mind required a great deal of development and, due to my workload with completing graduation and a few client projects, I just couldn&rsquo;t find the time. In the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve been looking at alternatives to doing the whole thing on my own. I looked at a few offerings:</p>
<p>1. Graffiti</p>
<p>2. Umbraco</p>
<p>3. Dnn</p>
<p>4. AxCMS</p>
<p>5. BlogEngine.Net</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The things I was gunning for:</p>
<p>1. Easy to set up</p>
<p>2. Easy to administer</p>
<p>3. Easy to extend</p>
<p>4. Easy to change the look</p>
<p>5. Must support adding my own pages / running my own code on a few pages</p>
<p>6. Something I can work on in my free time &ndash; not something one shot (as in you upload and it&rsquo;s fixed, unless you spend hours developing)</p>
<p>7. Not cause me any headaches</p>
<p>8. Cost</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Graffiti</strong></p>
<p>Well&hellip;I looked here and there and I found a cool post by Joe Stagner (<a href="http://misfitgeek.com/blog/community/my-move-to-graffiti/">http://misfitgeek.com/blog/community/my-move-to-graffiti/</a> ) and I thought it was the right place to begin. I downloaded the express edition. I installed it and my initial reaction was &ldquo;hmmm&hellip;let&rsquo;s see if it gets better&rdquo;. Playing around, it seems a very good package that does what it&rsquo;s touted to do &ndash; it publishes content. Now, I wanted to be able to create a gallery like page that I may need for tutorials. I wanted something that would allow me to code Asp.net and not just html. Wasn&rsquo;t exactly the easiest thing to do. I spent a couple of hours <em>wanting</em> to find out how to do it. Couldn&rsquo;t. It seems everything is a blog post &ndash;and if you&rsquo;re ok with that, Graffiti is awesome. I&rsquo;m looking for some extensibility &ndash; without getting into the labyrinths of the API. For this, I can&rsquo;t support Graffiti. Very reluctantly, I moved on. Sorry Telligent. Sorry Joe.</p>
<p><strong>2. Umbraco</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking to give umbraco a run for quite some time. I nearly used it way back in &lsquo;04 when my boss wanted me to look at a few CMSes. At that time, the priorities changed and the CMS stuff was left in the dust. Umbraco was a nightmare to install back then &ndash; that didn&rsquo;t help its cause.</p>
<p>So I download umbraco, installation is a breeze. Although, on my dev Win7 machine, I needed to change a few settings in IIS. I remember having to use the classic pipeline and also having to have umbraco in the root. That means it didn&rsquo;t work in a sub folder of Default Website, even when configured as an application. I was looking to use the CMS at the root of my site, so that wasn&rsquo;t a (big) problem.</p>
<p>This time, my reaction was &ldquo;Whoah&hellip;this is cool.&rdquo; The admin tool is awesome. It worked well with SQL Server. I was happy. Then came the extensibility test. One of the things umbraco is famous for is supported developer created modules (user controls). Since I had this in the back of my head, I thought umbraco would be a sure shot winner here. Unfortunately, it was not so. Yes, umbraco is very extensible. Yes, it can be made to do anything I want. Thing is, I didn&rsquo;t want to have to &ldquo;make&rdquo; it do anything. I didn&rsquo;t want to have to learn an API just so I could run my own Asp.net code. From Joes blog post mentioned earlier: <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s flexible, really flexible. I&rsquo;m sort of in a hurry. Umbraco wants to be embraced.&rdquo;</em> Also, my blog was at <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ashicmahtab">http://weblogs.asp.net/ashicmahtab</a> &ndash; that&rsquo;s on Community Server. It can export BlogML. I wanted those posts on this site. I wanted feeds to be done automatically. The blog modules for umbraco seem to be left wanting in terms of features. Sorry Neils&hellip;it would have taken too much of my time to get to where I wanted to be.</p>
<p><strong>3. Dnn</strong></p>
<p>Disclaimer: I <em>hate</em> dnn. Yet I am forced to work with it from time to time. Possibly that&rsquo;s a reason for my hatred. It&rsquo;s freakin&rsquo; awesome and it&rsquo;s a freakin&rsquo; nightmare. It&rsquo;s overkill for most things. It has some really cool features, but there&rsquo;s a lot of bloat. And talk about extensibility &ndash; I can do anything if I create a module for it. But creating a module for each and everything isn&rsquo;t my cup of tea. It&rsquo;s counter-intuitive. Still, I installed it. installed the blog module. Made a few blog posts. It was acceptable. But I wasn&rsquo;t happy. It&rsquo;s blogging features wasn&rsquo;t exactly great, but it was the best I had till then. It may have even made it&rsquo;s way to my site. Hey &ndash; there&rsquo;s even a LiveWriter plugin.</p>
<p><strong>4. AxCMS</strong></p>
<p>This used to be a pricey product, but it&rsquo;s free in toned down mode. Unfortunately, it was too toned down for my taste. Next.</p>
<p><strong>5. BlogEngine.Net</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d actually started on getting a blog ready using dnn, when &ndash;almost by accident and reasons unknown to me, I decided to install BlogEngine. Just for laughs. <em>Hey, I want a site, not <strong>just</strong> a blog.</em> Still, I downloaded, set the db to SQL 2005, changed the web.config. Ran the site &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t look too good, but let&rsquo;s see how we can change that, shall we? I looked at how I could theme it. The admin panel couldn&rsquo;t do anything &ndash;it didn&rsquo;t even allow me to edit the css. So, how on earth am I supposed to style this thing. And then it hit me &ndash; there&rsquo;s a theme folder with folders for each theme. And in those folders, there&rsquo;s a real life MasterPage and user controls for PostView and CommentView. There&rsquo;s css and images and everything. I could work with the aspx code. I could plant in any user or server controls I wanted. That&rsquo;s when I started giving this some serious consideration. I started looking around for how I could put my own code and pages into the system. Well, it supports user controls very easily. Just [usercontrol:path] type syntax is all that&rsquo;s needed. That&rsquo;s HUGE. It also supports adding pages from the admin panel. There&rsquo;s one drawback to that approach &ndash; the url becomes something like &ldquo;www.heartysoft.com/page/pageName.aspx&rdquo;. Many people don&rsquo;t seem to like the &ldquo;page&rdquo; section in the middle there. That wasn&rsquo;t too big a downer for me. Next, I saw that you can derive your custom aspx page from a BlogEngine.Net type, and it&rsquo;d simple carry out all the theming and Masterpage assignment. You could then code the page however way you wanted. That&rsquo;s the knockout blow right there. I can code my own asp.net code and seamlessly integrate it into BlogEngine.Net. So, I put my site up. And no, I don&rsquo;t like the theme I&rsquo;m using. I&rsquo;ll probably change it if / when I get some free time. And even if I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s still useable. I can add sections and pages that hold my own code later on when I get the time. It supports feedburner, is completely open source, works with SQL Server without any hassles, theming is changing aspx markup &ndash; just like editing my own markup. Importing from the Community Server generated BlogML was smooth on my pc (although a little trickier for my remote server &ndash; I&rsquo;ll save that for another post). All in all, I&rsquo;ve got my basic&nbsp; site up and running in less than half a day. And the best thing is that I can change it, add to it and work it as if it&rsquo;s my own app &ndash; without knowing anything about the API. Granted, I can do some cool stuff with the API, but that should be optional. I should be able to use my own code when I want to and need to &ndash; without being forced to swallow a framework. And this is where BlogEngine.Net has excelled above and beyond the others I&rsquo;ve tried.</p>
<p>Even after installing, I didn&rsquo;t expect to be quite this happy with this thing, and yet I am. If you haven&rsquo;t tried it yet, go ahead. Go to the site: <a href="http://dotnetblogengine.net/">http://dotnetblogengine.net/</a> , download it now, give it a shot. It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
