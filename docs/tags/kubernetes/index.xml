      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve started using Kubernetes, and came across an obvious thing that wasn&amp;rsquo;t apparent until we realised what it was. We were setting up a Kafka Schema Registry, and a Spark cluster on Kubernetes. Things seemed to work, except we suddenly saw that they didn&amp;rsquo;t. Digging down, we saw that the Schema Registry was failing during initialisation stating that SCHEMA_REGISTRY_PORT is deprecated. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out what was injecting the environment variable called SCHEMA_REGISTRY_PORT, and why it suddenly started getting injected, having worked fine before.</description>
