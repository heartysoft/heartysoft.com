      <description>Last week, I messed up. I was doing some stuff with react redux, and got annoyed at having to sudo install npm stuff. Now there are a few ways around this, but instead of using those, I followed the official page at https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions. Here&amp;rsquo;s the steps I followed:

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Arch (more specifically Antergos) for a while now. This morning I was trying to set up RStudio, and saw that the package I likely want is rstudio-desktop-bin. I tried to yaourt -S it, and during the install, it was trying in install a dependency called gstream. The specific version it was trying to install was built from source, and that source repo had a submodule named common. Unfortunately, the submodule used the git:// protocol that our office firewall blocked.</description>

      <description>I seem to be looking for this frequently, and can never remember it. So, more of a reminder for me (and for others!)
&amp;nbsp;
find ./ –not –newermt 2015-06-23 | xargs rm –rf
&amp;nbsp;
This finds all the stuff in the current path (./) that hasn’t changed after 2015-06-23, and deletes them.</description>
