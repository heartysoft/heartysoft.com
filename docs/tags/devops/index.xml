      <title>Friendly Names for AWS ELBS</title>

      <description>Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) in AWS allow us to access load balanced resources via single endpoints. While useful, a common problem is that they have hideous names. A dns name like internal-aaaaaabbbbcc359111e789ac0ac70354142-1111223232.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com isn&amp;rsquo;t the easiest thing in the world to remember, share, or use. We can use AWS Route53 to expose these load balancers with &amp;ldquo;friendly&amp;rdquo; names.
Say, I have a domain, mysite.com registered via Route53 as a public Hosted Zone.</description>

      <title>Kubernetes and Weird Environment Variables</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve started using Kubernetes, and came across an obvious thing that wasn&amp;rsquo;t apparent until we realised what it was. We were setting up a Kafka Schema Registry, and a Spark cluster on Kubernetes. Things seemed to work, except we suddenly saw that they didn&amp;rsquo;t. Digging down, we saw that the Schema Registry was failing during initialisation stating that SCHEMA_REGISTRY_PORT is deprecated. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out what was injecting the environment variable called SCHEMA_REGISTRY_PORT, and why it suddenly started getting injected, having worked fine before.</description>
