      <description>Kubernetes PodPresets are an interesting features. It allows us to define some common things about containers, and reuse them across different things (like deployments). For example, in my current project, we have some Kubernetes secrets relating to FTP connections. We use Airflow for orchestration, and as part of the workflow, sensors running in the Airflow container detect if particular files on FTP have changed. If they have, then a step in the workflow is triggered that runs a different pod in the cluster.</description>

      <title>Cross AWS Account Builds - Part 2</title>

      <description>At the end of part 1, we have an IAM role created in our account, OURTHING which has the required permissions in our account, and allows a user in the BUILD account to assume this role provided they specify a matching ExternalId - which in this case is &amp;ldquo;some_key_build&amp;rdquo;.
Steps for BUILDACCOUNT We&amp;rsquo;ll need an IAM user in BUILD account which we can use to run our builds. We&amp;rsquo;ll need the BUILD account admin to create this for us.</description>

      <description>Getting cross AWS account permissioning working seems like a black art. At my current client, we have our own AWS Account, with stuff like Kubernetes, Elasticsearch, Postgres, Cassandra, etc. running. However, another team manages a Gitlab Enterprise set up which is hosting our codebases. We could set up our own source control, and build server, and we very well might do that. But for now, the quickest bang for the buck is to leverage what the other team are allowing us to use.</description>

      <title>Public ELBs with Private Kubernetes</title>

      <description>Kubernetes services allow us to address a collection of pods through a stable endpoint. Depending on the service type, this endpoint may be addressable only from within the cluster, from the same network, or even from the public internet. When running on AWS, setting the service type for a service to LoadBalancer will create an AWS ELB, which can be used as the endpoint. Wih a Kubernetes cluster running on public subnets, this just works.</description>

      <title>Friendly Names for AWS ELBS</title>
      <link>http://heartysoft.com/ashic/blog/2017/05/friendly-names-for-aws-elbs/</link>

      <description>Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) in AWS allow us to access load balanced resources via single endpoints. While useful, a common problem is that they have hideous names. A dns name like internal-aaaaaabbbbcc359111e789ac0ac70354142-1111223232.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com isn&amp;rsquo;t the easiest thing in the world to remember, share, or use. We can use AWS Route53 to expose these load balancers with &amp;ldquo;friendly&amp;rdquo; names.
Say, I have a domain, mysite.com registered via Route53 as a public Hosted Zone.</description>
