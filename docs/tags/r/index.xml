      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Arch (more specifically Antergos) for a while now. This morning I was trying to set up RStudio, and saw that the package I likely want is rstudio-desktop-bin. I tried to yaourt -S it, and during the install, it was trying in install a dependency called gstream. The specific version it was trying to install was built from source, and that source repo had a submodule named common. Unfortunately, the submodule used the git:// protocol that our office firewall blocked.</description>
